# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Oracle Identity Governance(OIG) is a powerful and flexible enterprise identity management system that automatically manages user's access privileges within enterprise IT resources.

Application onboarding is the process of registering or associating an application with Oracle Identity Manager so that Oracle Identity Manager can provision or reconcile user information in or from that application.
Oracle Identity Manager provides a quick and convenient way to onboard applications by using the Applications option on the Manage tab in Identity Self Service. You can perform all the necessary configurations to onboard an application from a single console.
This simplified solution has the following benefits:
- You can configure new or existing applications by using a single user interface: Identity Self Service.
- You can export configurations as application templates and configure applications by using these templates, instead of Oracle Identity Manager.

*Estimated Lab Time*: 30 minutes

### About Product/Technology
Oracle Identity Management enables organizations to effectively manage the end-to-end lifecycle of user identities across all enterprise resources, both within and beyond the firewall and into the cloud. The Oracle Identity Management platform delivers scalable solutions for identity governance, access management and directory services. This modern platform helps organizations strengthen security, simplify compliance and capture business opportunities around mobile and social access.

Oracle Identity Governance is a powerful and flexible enterprise identity management system that automatically manages users' access privileges within enterprise IT resources. Its flexible architecture easily handles the most uncompromising and rigorous IT and business requirements -- without requiring changes to existing infrastructure, policies or procedures. Oracle Identity Governance is designed to manage user access privileges across all of a firm's resources, throughout the entire identity management lifecycle -- from initial creation of access privileges to dynamically adapting to changes in business requirements. Because of Identity Governance's innovative design, enterprises can elegantly incorporate necessary business changes at minimal cost, while avoiding enforced customization that might be necessary with other provisioning systems.
